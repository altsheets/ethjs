# ethjsre
Useful scripts for the JSRE console of Ethereum clones. To make my life easier on the commandline. 

### Preparations (once):

* [read the JS code](https://github.com/altsheets/ethjsre/blob/master/altsheets.js), so that you can trust it.  
* Press ``Raw``, and save it as "altsheets.js" (*)
           
(*) into the folder where you usually are when you type/click "gsoil attach"


### Each time you want to use it:

        gsoil attach
        loadScript("altsheets.js")
        help()



### new in version v0.3.13:
* github home
* running on 3 platforms (SOIL, EXP, ETH) !
* new ``status()`` = quick overview
* new ``statusLoop()`` - very useful during syncing



## TL;DR:
I now only have to type     ``bal()``

... and I see **all the balances** on **all my addresses**, incl. the **sum** of them all.
